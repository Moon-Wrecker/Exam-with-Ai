Modern Application Development II
Project Statement
Quiz Master - V2
It is a multi-user app (one requires an administrator and other users) that acts as an exam preparation site for multiple courses.


Frameworks to be used
These are the mandatory frameworks on which the project has to be built.


SQLite for data storage
Flask for API
VueJS for UI
VueJS Advanced with CLI
Bootstrap for HTML generation and styling (No other CSS framework is allowed)
SQLite for database (No other database is permitted)
Redis for caching
Redis and Celery for batch jobs

Note: All demos should be possible on your local machine.


The platform will have two roles:


Admin - root access - It is the superuser of the app and requires no registration

Admin is also known as the quiz master
There is only one admin to this application
The administrator login redirects to the quiz master/admin dashboard
The administrator will manage all the other users
The administrator will create a new subject
The administrator will add various chapters under a subject
The administrator will add quiz questions under a chapter

Application Wireframe
Quiz Master

 


Note:
The provided wireframe is intended only to illustrate the application's flow and demonstrate what should appear when a user navigates between pages.

Replication of the exact views is NOT mandatory.
Students are encouraged to work on their own front-end ideas and designs, while maintaining the application's intended functionality and flow.
Core Functionalities
Admin login and User login

A login/register form with fields like username, password etc. for user and admin login
The application should have only one admin identified by its role
You can use JWT token based authentication to implement role-based access control
The app must have a suitable model to store and differentiate all types of users
Admin Dashboard - for the Admin

The admin should be added, whenever a new database is created
The admin creates/edits/deletes a subject
The admin creates/edits/deletes a chapter under the subject
The admin will create a new quiz under a chapter
Each quiz contains a set of questions  (MCQ - only one option correct)
The admin can search the users/subjects/quizzes
Shows the summary charts

Quiz management - for the Admin

Edit/delete a quiz
The admin specifies the date and duration(HH: MM) of the quiz
The admin creates/edits/deletes the MCQ (only one option correct)  questions inside the specific quiz

User dashboard - for the User

The user can attempt any quiz of his/her interest
Every quiz has a timer
Each quiz score is recorded
The earlier quiz attempts are shown
To be able to see the summary charts
Note: The database must be created programmatically (via table creation or model code). Manual database creation, such as using DB Browser for SQLite, is NOT allowed.


5. Backend Jobs

a. Scheduled Job - Daily reminders - The application should send daily reminders to users on g-chat using Google Chat Webhooks or SMS or mail

Check if a user has not visited or a new quiz is created by the admin
If yes, then send the alert asking them to visit and attempt the quiz if it is relevant to them
The reminder can be sent in the evening, every day (students can choose the time)
b. Scheduled Job - Monthly Activity Report - Devise a monthly report for the user created using HTML and sent via mail.

The activity report can include quiz details, how many quizzes taken in a month, their score, average score, ranking in the quiz etc.
For the monthly report to be sent, start a job on the first day of every month → create a report using the above parameters → send it as an email
c.1 User Triggered Async Job - Export as CSV - Devise a CSV format details for the quizzes completed by the user


This export is meant to download the quiz details (quiz_id, chapter_id,  date_of_quiz, score, remarks etc.)
Have a dashboard from where the user can trigger the export
This should trigger a batch job, and send an alert once done

OR


c.2 User Triggered Async Job - Export as CSV - Devise a CSV format details for the all quizzes to be seen by the admin


This export is meant to download the user details (user_id, quizzes_taken, average score (performance), etc.)
Have a dashboard from where the admin can trigger the export
This should trigger a batch job, and send an alert once done

6. Performance and Caching


Add caching where required to increase the performance
Add cache expiry
API Performance

Recommended Functionalities
Well-designed PDF reports for Monthly activity reports (Students can choose between HTML and PDF reports)
External APIs/libraries for creating charts, e.g. ChartJS
Single Responsive UI for both Mobile and Desktop
Unified UI that works across devices
Add to desktop feature
Implementing frontend validation on all the form fields using HTML5 form validation or JavaScript
Implementing backend validation within your APIs
Optional Functionalities
Provide styling and aesthetics to your application by creating a beautiful and responsive front end using simple CSS or Bootstrap
Incorporate a proper login system to prevent unauthorized access to the app using Flask extensions like flask_login, flask_security etc.
Implement a dummy payment portal (just a view taking payment details from user for paid quizzes
Any additional feature you feel is appropriate for the application
